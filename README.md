This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error during array iteration.  The `BuggyArrayIteration.java` file shows the erroneous code, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The corrected version, `CorrectedArrayIteration.java`, demonstrates how to fix the issue by using the condition `i < arr.length`. This example is useful for illustrating the importance of careful array index management in Java programming.
